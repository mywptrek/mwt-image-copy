## Overview

**Frontend Image Copy to Clipboard** allows users to easily copy images they see on the frontend of your WordPress site and paste them into any other applications, inputs, or editors, including WordPress posts, emails, documents, or social media. This plugin offers seamless user experience by enabling simple copy and paste actions for image content.


## Features



* **Frontend Image Copy**: Users can click on any image on your site, copy it to their clipboard, and paste it into their media library, blog post, or external document.
* **Clipboard API Integration**: The plugin uses the modern Clipboard API to facilitate copying image data to the clipboard.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: No need for users to download or manually upload images. They can copy and paste images from the website directly into emails, WordPress editors, or any input field that supports images.
* **Customizable**: Admins can specify which images are copyable and where the functionality should be available.
* **Cross-Browser Support**: Works in modern browsers that support the Clipboard API (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge).


## Installation



1. Download the plugin from the WordPress plugin repository or upload the plugin ZIP file from the [plugin page].
2. Navigate to the **Plugins** section in your WordPress dashboard and click **Add New**.
3. Click **Upload Plugin**, select the ZIP file, and install it.
4. Once installed, click **Activate**.


## Configuration


### 1. General Settings

After activation, navigate to **Settings > Frontend Image Copy** to configure the plugin.



* **Enable for Specific Pages**: Choose specific pages or post types (e.g., blog posts, WooCommerce products) where users can copy images.
* **Enable/Disable for Image Types**: Select which types of images can be copied (e.g., featured images, gallery images).
* **Copy Tooltip**: Enable/disable a tooltip to appear on hover to indicate that an image can be copied.
* **Right-Click Context Menu**: Enable/disable the right-click option for users to copy images.


### 2. Shortcode for Custom Areas

To enable the image copy feature for a specific section of your website, use the following shortcode:


```
[copyable_image_area]
```


You can place this shortcode in posts, pages, or custom sections of your site. This makes all images within that area copyable.


## How to Use


### For Users:



1. **Hover Over the Image**: When hovering over a copyable image, a tooltip will indicate that the image can be copied.
2. **Right-Click or Click**: Right-click on the image and select "Copy image" from the context menu, or click the image to copy it directly (depending on how the admin configures the plugin).
3. **Paste the Image**: Users can now paste the copied image into any supported platform like email, WordPress editors, social media, or image fields (`Ctrl + V` on Windows or `Cmd + V` on Mac).


### Example Use Case:

Users visiting your WooCommerce store can copy product images directly to their clipboard and paste them into customer reviews, blog posts, or even emails when communicating about the products.
